# 🎉 Welcome to My Dev Playground!

Hey there! 👋 I'm Rahat, a **Full-Stack Developer** who loves turning ideas into scalable, high-performance applications. 🚀  
I enjoy building cool things on the web, solving tricky backend problems, and automating stuff to make life easier!  

### 🔥 What I Do  

- 🏗 **Build Things** – From sleek UIs to powerful backend systems, I love making apps that just work.  
- ⚡ **Scale & Optimize** – Whether it's real-time data, microservices, or caching strategies, I make sure things run smoothly.  
- 🛠 **Automate Everything** – CI/CD, Docker, cloud deployments? I set them up so things don’t break at 2 AM.  
- 🎥 **Real-time & WebRTC** – Experimenting with live video streaming and real-time updates for interactive experiences.
